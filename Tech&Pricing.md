# 💻 Tech Stack & Pricing Overview

An overview of all technologies used in this project along with their uses and pricing.

## ⚙️ Framework - Next.js

### 🔍 What it is:

Next.js is a modern web development framework built on top of React. It simplifies building high-performance websites and web applications with built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

### 🛠️ How we’ll use it:

We will use Next.js to build both the frontend and backend of your application. On the frontend, it will power everything the user sees and interacts with—such as the home page, dashboards, and other user-facing content. On the backend, we’ll take advantage of Next.js’s built-in API routes to handle server-side logic, such as form submissions, data fetching, authentication, and integrations with external services.

By using Next.js for the full stack, we ensure a faster development process, a more efficient architecture, and seamless communication between the client and server. This setup will also contribute to fast load times, SEO optimization, and a responsive user experience across all devices.
