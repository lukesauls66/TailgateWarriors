# Tech Stack

An overview of all technologies used in this project along with their uses and pricing.

## Framework - Next.JS

### What it is:

Next.js is a modern web development framework built on top of React. It simplifies building high-performance websites and web applications with built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

### How we'll use it:

We will use Next.js to build both the frontend and backend of your application. On the frontend, it will power everything the user sees and interacts with—such as the home page, dashboards, and other user-facing content. On the backend, we’ll take advantage of Next.js’s built-in API routes to handle server-side logic, such as form submissions, data fetching, authentication, and integrations with external services.

By using Next.js for the full stack, we ensure a faster development process, a more efficient architecture, and seamless communication between the client and server. This setup will also contribute to fast load times, SEO optimization, and a responsive user experience across all devices.

### Key Benefits:

- Speed & SEO: Pages load quickly and are search engine friendly thanks to server-side rendering and static generation.

- Scalability: Great for projects of all sizes, from MVPs to enterprise-scale apps.

- Built-in Routing: Simplifies page and URL creation without extra libraries.

- Full-stack capabilities: Allows us to build API endpoints within the same project, reducing the need for a separate backend for basic logic.

- Developer Efficiency: Built-in tooling (hot reload, TypeScript support, image optimization) allows faster development and maintenance.

### Pricing:

Next.js itself is open-source and free to use.

## Hosting - Vercel

### What it is:

Vercel is a cloud platform designed to host and deploy modern web applications, particularly those built with frameworks like Next.js. It is created by the same team behind Next.js, offering tight integration and optimized performance out of the box.

### How we'll use it:

We’ll use Vercel to host and deploy your entire application. This includes both the frontend and backend (API routes) built with Next.js. With Vercel, every change made to the codebase can be automatically deployed, making development faster and more reliable. Vercel also provides easy integration with your domain from GoDaddy, SSL certificates, preview environments, and global content delivery.

## Programming Language - TypeScript

### What it is:

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and enhanced tooling to the language. It helps developers catch errors earlier in the development process and write more reliable, maintainable code. TypeScript is compiled down to JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JavaScript runs—in the browser and on the server.

### How we’ll use it:

We’ll use TypeScript throughout the entire codebase—both on the frontend (user interface) and backend (API logic). This will improve code quality, prevent common bugs, and make the application easier to scale and maintain over time.

### Key Benefits:

- Fewer Bugs: Catches errors at build time instead of during runtime, which improves stability and reliability.

- Improved Developer Experience: Better code completion, navigation, and auto-suggestions in the development environment.

- Self-Documenting Code: Types make the code more understandable for anyone working on it in the future.

- Scalability: As the project grows, TypeScript makes it easier to manage larger codebases and onboard new developers.

### Pricing:

TypeScript is completely free and open source. There are no licensing costs, and it is fully supported by major frameworks and platforms, including Next.js and Vercel.

## Styling Framework - Tailwind CSS

### What it is:

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Instead of writing custom CSS from scratch, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that you apply directly in your HTML/JSX to style components.

### How we’ll use it:

We’ll use Tailwind CSS to build the frontend UI, ensuring the site is visually consistent, responsive, and easy to maintain. It will be applied across all pages—home, forms, dashboards, etc.—to handle layout, spacing, typography, and colors without writing complex custom CSS files.

### Key Benefits:

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly reliable, scalable, and secure cloud storage solution provided by Amazon Web Services. It is designed specifically to store and serve large volumes of files, such as images, videos, documents, and other media assets, with high durability and fast global access.

### How we’ll use it:

We’ll use AWS S3 to handle all file and image uploads for your application. When a user uploads a file, it will be securely stored in an S3 bucket. The application will then store a reference (like the file URL) in MongoDB for future access, without directly storing the file in the database.

### Key Benefits:

- Optimized for Media: Built for storing and delivering images, videos, and other static files.

- Scalable & Fast: Supports millions of file uploads/downloads with minimal latency via Amazon’s global CDN (CloudFront).

- Secure: Offers features like private buckets, public file access control, encryption, and presigned URLs for secure file uploads.

- Cost-Efficient: Pay only for the storage and bandwidth you use, with flexible storage classes for long-term or infrequent access.

- Seamless Integration: Works perfectly with Next.js/Node.js APIs, as well as with frontend file upload components.

### Pricing:

S3 is pay-as-you-go, and pricing is based on:

- Storage used (typically $0.023/GB/month for standard tier)

- Bandwidth (data out) beyond the first free 1GB/month (~$0.09/GB after)

- API requests (e.g., PUT, GET requests—fractions of a cent per 1,000 operations)

For most MVPs or early-stage apps, expect S3 costs to be under $5–$10/month unless you're hosting many large files or serving high download traffic.
